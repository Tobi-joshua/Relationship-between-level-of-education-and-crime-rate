Relationship between level of education and crime rate.
A criminologist studied the relationship between level of education and crime rate. He collected data from 84 medium-sized US counties. Two variables were measured: X- the percentage of individuals having at least a high-school diploma; and Y - the crime rate (crimes reported per 100,000 residents) in the previous year. The complete data is in “crimerate.txt”.
